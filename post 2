<p>Now, an ECU research team led by Professor Daniel Galvão has published the most convincing evidence to date that exercise doesn’t just have physical benefits for people with cancer.</p>

<p>The study, published in the Nature journal&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41391-021-00327-2">Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases</a></em>, is the first randomised control trial to examine the long-term effects of different exercise modalities on psychological distress of men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.</p>

<p>With up to one in four men experiencing anxiety either before or after prostate cancer treatment and up to one in five reporting depression, the need for holistic cancer care has never been greater.</p>

<p>According to Professor Galvão, exercise could be a simple way to improve symptoms of distress in men with prostate cancer.</p>

<p>"We've known about the physical benefits of exercise for cancer patients for some time, but our recent findings are the first to support the long-term positive effects on psychological distress of men with prostate cancer," Professor Galvão said.</p>
