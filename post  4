<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will begin with the causes. Being aware of what causes the illness, will make it easier to prevent catching the viral fever.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, viral fever gets communicated from one person to another by direct contact with the infected person's bodily fluids. Understanding it is much simpler than you think. Let us look at some common causes of viral fever people are generally unaware of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When an infected person coughs, yawns, sneezes or even talks, they happen to spray small particles of fluids that contain the bacteria and viruses. If you are standing close to that person, these bacteria enter your body via the nose or mouth and you may get infected. Once infected, it would take about 16 to 48 hours for it to turn into a full-blown infection.</p>

<h3>Moving on to diagnosis:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your doctor would look at your symptoms and come to a conclusion about your illness. However, in some cases, the doctor would prescribe blood tests to rule out other conditions like typhoid,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dettol.co.in/common-infections/illnesses/ways-to-protect-your-child-from-dengue-fever/">dengue</a>, malaria, chikungunya, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A blood test may also be prescribed in situations where your doctor needs to distinguish between the causative organisms. In simple terms, your doctor wants to know whether the fever is caused by bacteria or virus.</p>

<h2>Treatment of Viral Fever</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are down with viral fever, it is suggested that you take ample rest and have warm and soothing food like soup and khichdi till you feel fine. If you have a severe case of high fever and body ache, you should visit your doctor pronto.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We suggest not to indulge in self-medication by relying on antipyretics, antibiotics and analgesics. More importantly, you need to remember that in the case of viral fever, antibiotics are completely useless. Antibiotics are used to tackle bacteria and not viruses; so by taking them, you are unnecessarily inviting acidity and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dettol.co.in/common-infections/illnesses/causes-of-stomach-infection-and-how-to-prevent-it-from-happening/">stomach disturbances</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the doctor prescribes medicines, make sure that you take the entire course even after you start feeling better. Discontinuing antibiotics in the middle of the course causes the antibodies to become resistant to the bacteria. This puts you and everyone around you at risk of getting infected.</p>
